            <h2>Environmental Impacts of Food Production</h2>
            <p>Although food is essential for humans, its production is a massive environmental concern. 
            In recent years, there has been a lot of attention to meat production, which directly contributes to sustainability
            issues such as carbon dioxide emissions. However, there are also concerns within the crop production industry, 
            which poses a threat to biodiversity as well as contribute largely to the issues posed by meat production, namely land and water.</p>
